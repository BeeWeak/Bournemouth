# The readme file 

This is the default file to be displayed when viewing a repo online. It can be used to communicate information and instructions etc. So if there is a readme file take a look at it.

## The Starter Site
This repo contains the starter code for the Web coding tasks for the POP unit 

The starter site contains a home page (index.html) and  various other files for styling and testing things. Each week we will add the files we need to do the next set of Web coding tasks. So by the end of the Semester you will not only know how to write HTML pages but also your way around a basic website file structure. So make sure you keep a backup of your work - why not use GitHub?
